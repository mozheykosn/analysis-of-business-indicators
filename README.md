Product - the entertainment application Procrastinate Pro+.

In recent months, the application has been operating at a loss, despite significant advertising budgets.

The goal is to identify the causes and help the company turn a profit.

Tasks:

- Determine where users come from and what devices they use,
- Determine the cost of attracting users from different advertising channels;
- Determine how much money each customer brings in,
- Determine when customer acquisition costs are recovered,
- Identify factors that hinder customer acquisition.

There is data available on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019:
- Server logs with information about their site visits,
- Download of their purchases for this period,
- Advertising expenses.

Data description:
There are three datasets available. The file visits_info_short.csv contains the server log with information about site visits, orders_info_short.csv contains information about orders, and costs_info_short.csv contains information about advertising expenses.

**Conclusion**

Based on the entire study, several main reasons why advertising does not pay off can be identified:

Low retention rate for the application as a whole, with most users leaving on the second day.
The most financially viable region, the United States, is not profitable compared to other countries. The cost of attracting users from the United States is constantly increasing, while retention of users from the United States is rapidly declining every day.
Three channels do not pay off even after 14 days: Tip-Top, Faceboom, AdNoneSense. At the same time, the main budget goes to two of them, Tip-Top and Faceboom. Sharp increase in CAC at Tip-Top. Decrease in retention for all channels on the second day. Faceboom and AdNoneSense have the lowest retention, which stands out against other channels.
Here are some recommendations for the marketing department:

Review the advertising in the United States, study in detail which users affect the high CAC, perhaps this is the wrong gender, age, certain regions of the United States. Also find out why users from the United States are not returning to the application. Set up retargeting for old users, consider promotions, push notifications, or newsletters.
Expand geo: set up advertising for other countries in Europe (Scandinavian countries, Italy, Poland), increase the budget for current European countries (Germany, UK, and France), and consider alternative countries where users may have high activity, such as the Philippines, i.e., countries where English is widely spoken and the application is relevant.
Review advertising channels, increase the budget for the most profitable channels: YRabbit, MediaTornado, lambdaMediaAds, and reduce the budget for TipTop and FaceBoom. Review UTP and banners for these channels and conduct new tests.
Study what changes occurred in June, apart from the budget increases, that could have affected the deteriorating indicators, to avoid making mistakes again.
